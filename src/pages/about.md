Hi! I'm Tyler Angelier, a software developer and car enthusiast. Here are a few things about me:

- I work for Oracle in the Local Government Global Industry Unit on the Public Safety Suite team. I serve as an IC4 team lead for the Digital Media Systems team.
- Most of my day-to-day work involves backend services in Java using the Spring Boot framework. I also dabble in React for frontend applications and enjoy systems design.
- I _love_ cars—especially European ones. I own a 2020 BMW M2 Competition, and it’s truly my pride and joy.
- I'm a huge F1 fan and proudly team Max Verstappen. Working at Oracle makes it extra exciting since we're a platinum sponsor for Red Bull Racing—but honestly, I'd follow Max to any team.
- I have an amazing girlfriend I couldn’t imagine life without.
